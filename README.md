🧑‍💻 Well rounded software engineer, with a keen interest in Machine Learning, Blockchain & Web3.0 and Freelancing.

💻 Highly motivated, success oriented individual, seeking the touch of perfection in each line of code I write.
   I'm dedicated to build awesome projects that will bring me joy and help others in their software journey.
   Since I love to teach others the skills I know, why not try to teach computers too - thus my interest for Machine Learning.
